Hello, my name is Tianxiang Wang. I'm from Harbin, China. Now I'm studying at the University of Helsinki. I'm currently a first year master's student. My major is language technology. 

My hobby is singing, and my main favorite is Chinese pop songs from the 2000s to 2010s. My favorite singer is Jolin Tsai. Out of all her albums, *Play* is the one I like the most.
